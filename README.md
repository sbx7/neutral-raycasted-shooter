# Neutral Raycasted shooter
A raycaster shooter that sucks and has wall running (not done)

#How to play
Download the HTML file it's that simple

You can also compile the source code to other formats (I would add the game as a application here but there's file size limits)

# Language
It's built for turbowarp, doesn't use scratch or it won't work (custom turbowarp plugins)

[Download turbowarp here to work with the source code (web app also available)](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/)
